# Sparse Learning and Boosting

## Winnow

[Winnow Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnow_(algorithm))

## Strong Learnability

### Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)

[Probably approximately correct learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning)

Almost certainly generalizes really well

## Weak Learning

Has a slight chance of generalizing slightly better than chance.

## Boosting

[Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning))

### AdaBoost
