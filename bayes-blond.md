Q: If the proportion of blonds among blue-eyed people is greater than
among the population as a whole, is it also true that the proportion
of blue-eyed people among blonds is greater than among the population
as a whole?

B = blue eyes
H = hair is blond

Q: Does P(H|B) > P(H) â†’ P(B|H) > P(B) ?

P(H|B) > P(H)
P(B|H) P(H) / P(B) > P(H)
P(B|H) > P(B)
