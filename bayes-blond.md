Q: If the proportion of people with cancer among tall people is greater than among the population as a whole, is it also true that the proportion of tall people among people with cancer is greater than among the population as a whole?

C = Cancer
T = Tall

Q: Does P(C|T) > P(C) â†’ P(T|C) > P(T) ?

P(C|T) > P(C)
P(T|C) P(C) / P(T) > P(C)
P(T|C) > P(T)
