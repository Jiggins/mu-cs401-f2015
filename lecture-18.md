+ Graphical models and bayes nets => supposedly the future of ml.
+ However inference from graphs is considered an intractible problem.



##Matrix decomposition 
___

+In general matrix decomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices. In particular we talk about non-negative matrix 
factorization(NMF), that is we factorize a matrix into two matrices such that all three matrices are element wise non-negative.

+Many problems can be rephrased as matrix decomposition and thus it is a handy tool to have in the machine learning shed.

###Example
