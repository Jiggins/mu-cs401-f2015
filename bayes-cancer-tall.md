Q: If the proportion of people with cancer among tall people is greater than among the population as a whole, is it also true that the proportion of tall people among people with cancer is greater than among the population as a whole?

### Formalize

    C = Cancer
    T = Tall
    Does P(C|T) > P(C) â‡’ P(T|C) > P(T) ?

According to Bayes' Rule

    P(C|T) = P(T|C) P(C) / P(T)

so,

    P(C|T) > P(C)
    P(T|C) P(C) / P(T) > P(C)
    P(T|C) > P(T)

yes.
