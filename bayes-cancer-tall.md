Q: If tall people are more likely to get cancer, then are people who get cancer more likely to be tall?

### Formalize

    C = Cancer
    T = Tall
    Conjecture: P(C|T) > P(C) â‡’ P(T|C) > P(T)

According to Bayes' Rule

    P(C|T) = P(T|C) P(C) / P(T)

so,

    P(C|T) > P(C)
    P(T|C) P(C) / P(T) > P(C)
    P(T|C) > P(T)

yes.
